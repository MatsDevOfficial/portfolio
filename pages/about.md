# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I work on a lot of project, mainly projects for fun, [the openbase foundation](https://github.com/OpenBase-Foundation) and school. Most of my projects will be website related. However, you may find some others regarding software and operating systems.
